        <h2>Hello, and Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          The Long Road Home is available now from Amazon or directly from the
          publisher, Finishing Line Press. When I was nineteen years old, I knew
          that I wanted to spend my life writing poems and teaching poetry. A
          lifetime later, after working with MFA graduate students and K-12
          students, speaking to audiences large and small at colleges,
          libraries, bookstores, and conventions from Atlanta to Portland,
          Oregon, from New Orleans to Madrid, Spain, Iâ€™m still writing poems and
          essays about poetry & poets, literature, politics, culture & family.

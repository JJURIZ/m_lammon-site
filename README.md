## Explanation

Mr. Lammon, a former guest on my podcats [Is Anything](http://isanythingpodcast.com), has retired from 
teaching. With an increased interest in his online presence Martin is considering an overhaul of this current site. The recent publication of his second book of poetry, THE LONG ROAD HOME, and a third book in the works, the time could not be better. I offered to create this proof of concept, using the conent on his [current site](http://martinlammon.com) to demonstrate the power of a revamped and updated look.
